# Node Console Playground

This is a cross-environment playground for the different things that can be done with the console using the tools available in Node.  The following projects and tests are included:

- snowflakes
  - clearing the entire screen
  - setting the text cursor position
- flappy-bit
  - a slightly more sophisticated example of the snowflakes, with the addition of user input
